# Mistwrite 
Mistwrite combines the fleeting essence of "Mist", and "write" indicating its function as a note-taking app. Offering a swift and intuitive and clutter free note-taking experience.

Yes, there are existing websites and applications that currently offer superior features compared to Mistwrite, particularly in terms of temporary note-taking and saved notes. I was always in a need for a quick launching, clutter-free solution, I created Mistwrite to fill this gap. 

It installs as a PWA and you can lauch it right from your homescreen, create notes for future reference (24H). It keeps your original note taking app, free from uneccessary lists of grocery items!

#### Features
- Installs as a PWA.
- Responsive to both desktop and mobile screens.
- Real time update on note deletion timer.
- Manual sync button
- App shortcuts


#### Stack
React, Appwrite, Tailwind, shadcn/ui and other notable utilities.
